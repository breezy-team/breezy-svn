Upgrading from bzr-svn 0.4.x to 0.5.x
=====================================

bzr-svn 0.5 introduces a new version of the mapping used by bzr-svn. This has
several advantages, such as making bzr-svn more flexible in what paths 
are considered branches and being able to work without bzr-specific file 
properties in a Subversion >= 1.5 repository when pushing/committing to that 
repository from bzr.

Disadvantage of this new mapping format is that older bzr-svn clients won't 
be able to recognize any bzr metadata on new revisions pushed using bzr-svn 0.5.

It is possible to make bzr-svn use the old-style mappings when pushing 
revisions by setting "default-mapping = v3" in ~/.bazaar/bazaar.conf or 
~/.bazaar/subversion.conf, for example if you still use older versions of 
bzr-svn that you can't upgrade.
