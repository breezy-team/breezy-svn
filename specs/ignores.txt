Ignores
=======

A fake .bzrignore file is generated containing the contents of the "svn:ignore"
properties. If a .bzrignore file already exists in the tree, 
the file already in the tree is used. 

The .bzrignore file contains the directories in which the ignores are 
set, ordered alphabetically by directory path. 

Ignores are only recognized on directories.
