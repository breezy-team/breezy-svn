 FEATURES

  * Pack relevant parts of the repository after fetch.

     the old SQLite database will be used.

     TDB allows multiple writers to the database. (#185200)

   * The version-info command now prints 'svn revno' and 'svn uuid' 
     when used in Subversion checkouts.

   * The info command now prints the repository UUID and last committed 
     revision number when used on Subversion repositories. (#320271)

   * Now registers a fallback credentials store, allowing

     access. This is useful accessing http(s) URLs will 
     always attempt to open using the native Bazaar formats 
     first.

   * Better error when pushing to a (diverged) empty branch. Unfortunately
     "bzr push" masks this better error at the moment. (#354929)

  BUG FIXES

   * Support working copies with non-ascii characters in the 
     base path. (#356845)

   * A new content filter "svn-keywords" is now supported and behaves like 
     the svn:keywords Subversion file property.

   * Keywords and end of line properties in svn working copies are now honored. 
     (#81463)

   * Support override-svn-revprops = svn:author=author to allow svn:author to be 
     set to the author of a pushed revision rather than the committer. (#342979)


bzr-svn 0.5.3                   2009-03-10

     accidently start to call update() on files.

   * Don't check branch root when looking for round-tripped revisions that used 
     revision properties. (#294784)

   * Support non-ascii characters in home directories. (#333121)

     with roundtripped revisions. (#332364)

   * Print proper error when it is impossible to get a branch path 
     in a particular layout. (#340081)

  PERFORMANCE

     InterBranch.pull() patch.

   * The guessed layout is now only stored in the configuration and no longer

   * Assume that ERR_XML_MALFORMED only occurs for non-Subversion 
     URLs. (#327287)

     when browsing history. 

   * More efficient pull from Subversion branches, avoiding unnecessary 
     calculation of revision numbers. (Requires InterBranch patch to bzr)

   * More efficient pull from Subversion branches, by using the local 
     branch ancestry to find out tag revision ids rather than the remote 
     Subversion branch.

   * Use VersionedFiles.insert_record_stream() rather than 
     VersionedFiles.add_lines(), should be slightly faster.
 
   * By default, don't use a cache for log information when connected 
     to a local Subversion repository.

   * Only fetch rebased revisions once during ``bzr dpush'', rather than 
     after every pushed revision.
   
   * Use only a single graph object during push, rather than two.

     by an older copy of themselves. (#316384)

   * Use unicode objects internally for sqlite. (#296868)

   * New implicit file id handling for copied directories.
    + Correctly handles implicit children when parent is copied from outside of the 
      branch. (#304134)
    + Correctly handles file id map generation for some stacked branches. (#310916)

  PERFORMANCE

   * Stop iterating over non-visible children of files when determining file ids. (#306259)
     This should improve the performance of stacking and lightweight checkouts.

   * Imports of svn-related modules is now done lazily. There will only be two extra 
     imports if bzr-svn is loaded but not used.

  API

   * Added accessor functions for Subversion file properties.

  BUG FIXES

   * Fix compatibility with Bazaar 1.9. (#279444)

   * Cope with pushing files changed into directories. (#277369)

   * Fix compatibility with Bazaar 1.7.

   * Use local application data directory on Windows for bzr-svn cache.
     (#231041)

     (#255159)

   * Fix forward declarations of Python types, fixes 
     compilation on mingw. (#263284)

   * Avoid explicit revnum reporting for inventory entries during fetch.

  CHANGES

   * Fix setup.py run with python2.4. (#256804)

   * Use rst2html.py rather than rst2html if it is available.

  BUG FIXES

   * Parse http redirect errors in some non-English locales better.

   * Avoid importing tags as branches in svn-import, now that tags are 
     converted to native Bazaar tags.

bzr-svn 0.4.11~rc1    2008-08-08

  CHANGES

   * bzr-svn now comes with its own Python bindings for the Subversion 
     libraries, removing the need for a unreleased version of Subversion and 
     improving performance.

     It does however mean the extensions have to be built. This requires 
     the Subversion development libraries and should be possible by 
     simply running ``make`` from the plugin directory. 

     This fixes some existing bzr-svn related bugs caused by Python-Subversion:

     * KeyboardInterrupts are now no longer swallowed.  (#242217)

     * Crash bug trying to access sites that use self-signed certificates. 
       (#238529)

     * Username and password prompting will now always work.

   * The "svn+https://..." syntax has been deprecated. It still works in the 
     current release but will be removed in the future. If you are unable to 
     get a repository to work without the svn+ prefix, please file a bug.

  FEATURES
  
   * Add new "dpush" command that works similar to git-svn's dcommit.

   * Support proper Bazaar tags. (#81102)

   * Set mergeinfo properties when pushing merges. (write part of #131323)

   * Basic (experimental) support for stacked branches. Not very
     efficient at the moment because of certain assumptions in the 
     stacking implementation.

   * Avoid reopening connections to branch and repository when finding 
     branches. (#243749)

   * Show Subversion revision numbers in log output. (#161830)

   * Extend "bzr help svn".

   * Warn when trying to clone a repository root as a branch. (#244638)

   * Much faster Repository.get_revision_delta(). (#127030)

   * Support bzr push --overwrite. (#118787)

   * Support bzr uncommit.

   * Support bzr sign-my-commits. (Requires revision properties in the 
     Subversion repository to be mutable)

   * Support pushing merged revisions. To enable, set 
     ``push_merged_revisions = True'' in the repository config. (#158883)

  BUG FIXES

   * Now uses absolute imports and no longer adds plugin directory to the 
     system path.

   * More efficient use of mutter.

   * Remember parent branch correctly during sprout. (#237174)

   * Raise appropriate errors when using annotate.

   * Fix compatibility with Bazaar 1.6.

     CachingLogWalker.find_latest_change(). (#233964)

   * Fix compatibility with newer versions of Subversion. (#229419)

   * Deal with parent branch changing name in Repository.iter_changes().
     (#229410)

   * Fix ability to use bzr-svn with disabling cache.

   * Fix use of unicode characters in filenames in working trees.

   * Fix use of unicode characters in filenames when committing. (#230090)

   * Cope with kind changes better. (#191576)

   * Fix dealing with strange remove during replace operation. (#232196)

   * Deal with missing branches/tags directories when using webdav. (#235301)

   * Remove endless loop in logwalker. (#235776)

   * Convert redirect requests received from Subversion. (#229848)

   * New function for finding path children that's faster and more correct. 
     (#240954)

   * Support cloning bzr-svn branches (will clone to rich-root-pack). (#229819)

   * Fix inconsistent revision iteration when branches' parents were moved but 
     not changed. (#237901)

   * Avoid assumption that a revision can only occur in one branch. (#208566)

   * Several fixes for dealing with non-acii characters. (#128496)

   * Re-use RA connections as much as possible. bzr-svn should in general now 
     have no more than 2 TCP/IP connections to the same Subversion repository 
     open at the same time. (#183824)

   * Cope with files that are special files but not symlinks. (#245788)

   * Deliver encoded paths in URLs to Subversion in switch() and reparent()
     functions. (#248892)

   * Lazily connect to repository when opening working copies. (#250706)

   * Stricter checking of special files for links. (#219832)

   * Avoid showing backtrace for RA_DAV_REQUEST_FAILED errors, since 
     they may be raised in other situations than when a bug is hit.
     (#253376)

   * Fixed http exception during expensive log -v. (#94316)

   * Preserve individual text revision ids correctly when round-tripping. (#250480)

bzr-svn 0.4.10  2008-05-12

  CHANGES

   * Changed license from GPLv2 or later to GPLv3 or later.

  FEATURES

   * Add new ``log-strip-trailing-newline'' option which removes 
     the last trailing newline from the log message when pushing 
     to Subversion. This feature is only available for the 
     experimental mappings. (#189227)

   * Allow more granularity over what properties are overridden using 
     ``override-svn-revprops''. (#159143)

   * Add new ``append-revisions-only'' option with similar behaviour 
     as in standard bzr formats. (#206242)

   * Parse mergeWithUpstream set by svn-buildpackage.

   * Cache last revision number during read locks, significantly speeds
     up push.

   * Use different cache for experimental versions of bzr-svn.

   * Support set_user_option() on Subversion branch BranchConfig. (#195962)

   * Support credentials in URLs. (#181534)

   * Allow usage without on-disk cache. This option is still 
     experimental. (#131008)

  PERFORMANCE

   * No longer calculate inventory sha1's for svn revisions. Should provide 
     some minor speed improvements.

   * Don't check full branch history when looking up the revno of a revision 
     id.

   * Restrict history sample size used for guessing branching scheme to avoid
     looking at the full history for very large repositories.

   * New option ``reuse-revisions'' that determines how hard bzr-svn will 
     try to reuse revisions when pushing into Subversion.

  INTERNALS

   * Branching from a Subversion repository will now fetch right-hand side 
     parents as well as left hand side (mainline) parents, if specified.

   * Removed revision number cache.

   * Switch to using "repository layouts" rather than branching schemes. 
     Layouts are not part of the mapping so don't affect the revision identity.

  BUGS

   * Avoid sometimes incorrect determination of Bazaar revision numbers. (#181773)

   * Deal with bzr:svn-revision-info property being removed. (#206728)

   * Gracefully handle erroneous svk merge tickets created by old versions of svk.

   * Use standard infrastructure for caching revision numbers. (#213953)

   * Work around bug in the Subversion libraries which don't accept 
     http(s) URLs with urlencoded characters. (#190229)

   * Make sure committer name is UTF-8 encoded when overriding 
     revision properties.

   * Fix installation of mapping3 package, don't rely on specific 
     version of Python. (#227891)

bzr-svn 0.4.9    2008-03-23

  FEATURES

   * Set revision properties when possible.

   * Avoid doing two branch property lookups when getting revision metadata.

   * Use caching revision graph.

   * --prefix is now determined from the specified url in svn-import. (#160335)

   * Support storing revision signatures.

   * Re-use file properties on branch root more efficiently. This made 
     the cache of branch properties unnecessary.

   * Avoid using copy in several places.

  BUGS
  
   * Fix compatibility with bzr 1.3.

   * Be a bit quieter with messages about experimental mappings. (#162496)

   * Properly warn when trying to open a working copy with a newer version.

   * More correct implementation of Repository.get_ancestry(). 

   * Properly use current branching scheme when following branches. (#183361)

   * Avoid using special characters in branching scheme names because it 
     breaks over http/https. (#204759). 

  INTERNALS

   * Allow multiple mappings to be available at the same time.

  DOCUMENTATION

   * Add note about svn+ prefix to authentication question.

     inventory. (#183853)

   * Fix too strict indexing in old existing cache databases. (#165136)

   * Handle children of replaced directories, themselve replaced correctly. (#181790)

   * Handle corner cases tracking branches. (#184457)

   * Avoid errors about invalid branching paths unless the branching scheme 
     was specified explicitly.

   * Change default format to rich-root-pack. (#187008)

   * Fix handling of weird file change after replacing from other branch.
     (#186876)

bzr-svn 0.4.6    2008-01-08

  PERFORMANCE
  
   * Remember where revids have already been detected. Makes incremental
     push a lot faster, in particular in Subversion repositories 
     with a lot of branches. (#139364)

   * Work around memory leak in the Python Subversion bindings of svn.ra.get_log().

   * Deal with kind changes that don't change file contents. (#178149)

bzr-svn 0.4.5    2007-12-01

  IMPROVEMENTS

   * Add revision specifier for "svn:" that accepts a single revision number. (#160605)

  INTERNALS

   * No longer store svn:author, svn:date and svn:log in the bzr-svn cache. 
     This should make it easier to use bzr-specific revprops later on and 
     saves some disk space.

   * Use new rich-roots format everywhere rather than experimental 
     dirstate-with-subtree.

  BUG FIXES

   * Properly decode unicode commit messages. 

   * Handle some corner cases when finding branches.
