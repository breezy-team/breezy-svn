bzr-svn 0.4	UNRELEASED
  
  BUG FIXES

   * Non-ascii characters in file ids are now supported (fixes imports 
     of the Python repository).

   * Fixed error raised during version incompatibility. (Wouter van Heyst, 
                                                         #80467)

   * Implemented Repository.get_revision_graph(None)

   * svn-import will no longer spin using CPU if the target directory 
     did not exist (#80223).

   * Remove branches when they are being replaced. Fixes DivergedBranches 
     error when using svn-import (#81908).

   * Support true push (#80612).

   * Support commits in heavy checkouts (#79330).
   
   * Use shared repositories by default in svn-import command.

   * Put branching schemes in revision ids.

   * Support using custom branching schemes.

   * Add blackbox test for svn-import with dumpfile. (#123493)

	 finding file id mappings.

  INTERNALS

   * Implement SvnRaTransport.local_abspath(). (#117090)

   * Implement SvnRemoteAccess.create_branch().
