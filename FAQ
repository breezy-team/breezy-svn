bzr-svn frequently asked questions
==================================

.. contents::

Bazaar is using a lot of memory accessing a Subversion repository
-----------------------------------------------------------------
bzr-svn can use a lot of memory cloning big branches when older 
versions of the python-subversion bindings are used. This memory leak 
has been fixed in the trunk of Subversion (r28544) and has been 
proposed for inclusion in Subversion 1.4.7.

One way to work around this problem is to Ctrl+C the branch operation 
and restart it.

I am unable to access a repository that requires user/password authentication.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Python bindings required for password prompting are only present in 
version 1.5 of Subversion so password prompting is only possible if 
you have that version installed.

If you have an older version installed, bzr-svn can 
use passwords cached by Subversion. Subversion can be forced to cache 
the password by accessing the repository using the Subversion command-line 
client. For example, try running 'svn info <url>'.

Trying to branch into repository gives an error about incompatibility.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a repository and then trying to clone a Subversion branch into 
that repository may cause the following error:

::

  bzr: ERROR: Repository KnitRepository is not compatible with repository SvnRepository

bzr-svn requires a repository format that supports recording root file ids. To 
upgrade the repository, run: 

::

 $ bzr upgrade --rich-root-pack

Pushing a branch that didn't exist in Subversion yet with `bzr push` fails.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the moment, only `bzr svn-push` can be used to push new branches into 
Subversion. Future releases will include this functionality in `bzr push`.

More information can be found in the bug report at:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr-svn/+bug/127945.

Cloning a large Subversion branch is very slow
----------------------------------------------
There is no way around this at the moment, because Bazaar has to import all 
the history from the Subversion branch as it doesn't support so-called 
history horizons yet. 

More information about history horizons can be found at:
http://bazaar-vcs.org/HistoryHorizon

The Bazaar revno's differ from the Subversion revno's
-----------------------------------------------------
That's right. Bazaar revision numbers are per-branch, whereas Subversion revno's are per-repository. If you 
would like to use Subversion revision numbers, use the "svn:" revision specifier. For example:

::

  $ bzr ls -rsvn:34 svn://example.com/bar

Bazaar reports branches have diverged while pulling, when they haven't
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As of version 0.4, bzr-svn creates revisions with different revision ids than 
previous versions. In other words, existing bzr-svn branches created with 
0.3.x can not be used directly with 0.4.0 but will have to be upgraded to 
work with 0.4.0 using the "bzr svn-upgrade" command. The bzr-rebase package 
has to be installed for this command to work correctly.

Is it possible to keep the author name when pushing changes into Subversion?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, but this requires the repository to allow revision property changes. 

See hooks/pre-revprop-change in the Subversion repository for 
more information about how to do this.

You also need to enable support for this in bzr-svn by setting 
override-svn-revprops to True in ~/.bazaar/bazaar.conf.

I converted my Subversion repository using svn-import, but now all branches are empty!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

bzr-svn does not create working trees by default. If you need 
the working trees, run "bzr checkout" in the branch or 
specify --trees to svn-import.

bzr-svn did a replace operation when I tried to push a merge commit to Subversion
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, this is because bzr-svn has to preserve the left-hand side history of your 
branch. 

If you would like to avoid this, use a checkout and merge into that ("bzr co") 
or rebase on trunk rather than merge it.
