Installation
------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bazaar
^^^^^^

You will need a recent version of Bazaar, usually the release of Bazaar 
released in the same month as the release of bzr-svn you are using. bzr-svn 
will warn if the Bazaar release used is too old or too new.

SQLite
^^^^^^

If you are using Python 2.4, you will need to have the pysqlite module 
installed.  Python 2.5 and higher have sqlite support built in. 

Subversion development files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need the Subversion libraries, including the development files. This should
be readily packaged for most platforms. The package name for Debian 
and Debian-based distributions such as Ubuntu is ``libsvn-dev``. 

bzr-rebase
^^^^^^^^^^

In order to be able to use the ``svn-upgrade`` command (for those 
who used versions of bzr-svn older than 0.4.0), you will need the `bzr-rebase`_ 
plugin.

.. _bzr-rebase: http://bazaar-vcs.org/Rebase

Building
~~~~~~~~

Simply place this directory in ~/.bazaar/plugins and you should be able 
to check out branches from Subversion using bzr. Make sure the directory 
name is 'svn'. The plugin has to be built as well by running ``make``.

Packages
~~~~~~~~

Instead of installing the plugin yourself, you can also install a prepackaged 
version of it for your platform.

Windows Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The standard `Windows installers for Bazaar`_ include bzr-svn.
