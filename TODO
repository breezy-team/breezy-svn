mappingv4:
- fix update_after_commit test
- find tags during iter_all_changes() during fetch
- iter_all_changes() doesn't follow non-layout (but mapping-approved) branch paths from older revisions that are part of the ancestors of a valid branch path revision properly

more tests:
- Run all tests against repository with revprop changing allowed and without
- performance tests (count roundtrips?)
- bzr:hidden
- bzr svn-set-revprops

performance:
- generate deltas rather than fulltexts when creating file id maps
- use replay and replay range to fetch revisions
- implement SvnWorkingTree.apply_inventory_delta()
