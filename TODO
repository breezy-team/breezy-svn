- fix update_after_commit test
- automatically disable cache in some situations, allow partial cache?

more tests:
- Run all tests against repository with revprop changing allowed and without
- performance tests (count roundtrips?)
- upgrades from v3
- bzr:hidden
- bzr svn-set-revprops

performance:
- generate deltas rather than fulltexts when creating file id maps
- fix copyfrom in replay and replay_range
- implement SvnWorkingTree.apply_inventory_delta()
