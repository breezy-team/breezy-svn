mappingv4:
- fix update_after_commit test
- handle upgrades from v3 properly
 - cope with old mappings in find_tags_between_*
 - set-revprops upgrades v3 stuff as well?
 - set-revprops should refuse to work when there is no commit-revprops capability
- automatically disable cache in some situations, allow partial cache?
- avoid checking properties in get_appropriate_mappings() unless really necessary
- in-memory caching of revid mapping (LRUCache ?)
- warn when retrieving revision properties slowly
- inventory problem that shows up in bigboard, evolution

more tests:
- Run all tests against repository with revprop changing allowed and without
- performance tests (count roundtrips?)
- bzr:hidden
- bzr svn-set-revprops

performance:
- generate deltas rather than fulltexts when creating file id maps
- fix copyfrom in replay and replay_range
- implement SvnWorkingTree.apply_inventory_delta()
