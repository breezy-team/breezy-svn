todo:

- avoid extra connect in logwalker?
- free memory! (#54253)
- more blackbox tests
 - svn-import without scheme specified should guess

.svn working trees:
- implement apply_inventory_delta()
- support merge without requiring revisions to be added to svn repository
- add tests for objects returned by WorkingTree.pull(), Branch.pull()
- don't update all entries to the same revnum when opening working tree
- when committing specific files in a lightweight checkout, make sure to 
  also commit the file property changes for the tree root
- faster "bzr status"
