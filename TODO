mappingv4:
- fix update_after_commit test
- handle upgrades from v3 properly
 - follow new mappings in find_iter()
 - return lhs parent mapping if necessary
 - check mapping for Branch.generate_revision_id()
- automatically disable cache in some situations, allow partial cache?

more tests:
- Run all tests against repository with revprop changing allowed and without
- performance tests (count roundtrips?)
- bzr:hidden
- bzr svn-set-revprops

performance:
- generate deltas rather than fulltexts when creating file id maps
- fix copyfrom in replay and replay_range
- implement SvnWorkingTree.apply_inventory_delta()
