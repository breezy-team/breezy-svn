- simplify find_branches by using Transport.list_dir() ?
- fix autorealm repository
- avoid extra connect in logwalker?
- allow branching scheme specified in magic property in repository root
- free memory!
- report changes to delta editor in Branch.pull()
- more blackbox tests
- integrate bzr:merge into bzr:revision-info or rename to bzr:merge-vXXYY
- transform file ids in workingtree in svn-upgrade
- more intelligent mechanism for finding branching scheme. Look at directory structure in current tree?

Working trees:
- custom implementation of WorkingTree.revert() / WorkingTree.merge()
- add tests for objects returned by WorkingTree.pull(), Branch.pull()
- what happened to WorkingTree.add() ?
- don't update all entries to the same revnum when opening working tree
- when committing specific files in a lightweight checkout, make sure to 
  also commit the file property changes for the tree root (except 
  for pending merges).														   
- faster "bzr status"
