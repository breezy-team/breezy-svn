todo:
- generate deltas rather than fulltexts when creating file id maps
- BzrDir.create_branch() should set the revision id to NULL_REVISION
- tests for setting svk:merge from .bzr checkout
- tests for http-specific SvnRaTransport._request_path() code
- tests for auth.py
- more blackbox tests
 - svn-import without scheme specified should guess
 - bzr missing
- transform file ids in workingtree in svn-upgrade
- more efficient implementation of get_revision_delta() to speed up bzr log -v
- nestedtree support
- lookup_revision_id()'s result depends on the current branching scheme, 
  causing weird errors when pushing

.svn working trees:
- implement apply_inventory_delta()
- support merge without requiring revisions to be added to svn repository
- add tests for objects returned by WorkingTree.pull(), Branch.pull()
- don't update all entries to the same revnum when opening working tree
- when committing specific files in a lightweight checkout, make sure to 
  also commit the file property changes for the tree root
- faster "bzr status"
