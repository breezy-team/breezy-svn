more tests:
- Run all tests against repository with revprop changing allowed and without
- performance tests (count roundtrips?)
- upgrades from v3
- bzr svn-set-revprops

performance:
- generate deltas rather than fulltexts when creating file id maps for the cache
- fix copyfrom in replay and replay_range
- implement SvnWorkingTree.apply_inventory_delta()
- needs_fetching() in RevisionFinder needs to work on sets of revisions
  rather than indivual revisions
- faster function for finding all *existing* tags for a project
- faster function for finding all *existing* branches
- automatically disable cache in some situations, allow partial cache?
 - perhaps for large repositories?
